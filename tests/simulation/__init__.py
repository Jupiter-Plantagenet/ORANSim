"""
The `tests/simulation` subpackage contains unit tests and integration tests for 
the simulation engine and related components in the ORANSim library.

These tests verify the correct behavior of:

- The `ORANScheduler` class, which manages the simulation environment and event scheduling.
- The integration between the scheduler and other components like mobility models, 
  network nodes, and interfaces.
- Simulation utilities in the `oransim/simulation/utils.py` module.

The tests in this subpackage ensure that the simulation engine functions as expected 
and that different parts of the simulation work together correctly.
