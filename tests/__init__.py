"""
The `tests` package contains unit tests and integration tests for the ORANSim library.

The tests are organized into subpackages that mirror the structure of the main library:

- `tests/core`: Tests for core components (nodes, RIC, mobility).
- `tests/interfaces`: Tests for interface implementations (A1, E2, O1, etc.).
- `tests/simulation`: Tests for the simulation engine and related utilities.
- `tests/xapp_rapp_framework`: Tests for the xApp/rApp framework.
- `tests/analytics`: Tests for data collection, analysis, and visualization.

The tests are written using the `pytest` framework and are designed to be run using 
the `pytest` command-line tool.
