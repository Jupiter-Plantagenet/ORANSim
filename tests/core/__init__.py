"""
The `tests/core` subpackage contains unit tests and integration tests for 
the core components of the ORANSim library.

These components include:

- Network nodes (O-RU, O-DU, O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP, UE)
- RIC (Near-RT RIC and Non-RT RIC)
- Mobility models

The tests in this subpackage verify the correct behavior and interactions of 
these core components in isolation and in combination.
