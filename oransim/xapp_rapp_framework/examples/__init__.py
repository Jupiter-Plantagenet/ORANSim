"""
The `examples` subpackage within `xapp_rapp_framework` provides example 
implementations of xApps and rApps to demonstrate the usage of the framework 
and to serve as a starting point for developing more complex applications.

This package contains example xApps and rApps such as:

- Handover management xApp (`handover_xapp.py`)
- Load balancing rApp (`load_balancing_rapp.py`)

These examples showcase how to:

- Define xApp and rApp classes inheriting from the base `xApp` and `rApp` classes.
- Interact with the Near-RT RIC and Non-RT RIC.
- Subscribe to and process E2 messages (for xApps).
- Create and manage A1 policies (for rApps).
- Integrate with the simulation environment.

You can use these examples as a guide to create your own custom xApps and rApps 
for different use cases and research scenarios.
