"""
The `interfaces` subpackage contains classes and modules that simulate the 
different interfaces in the 5G ORAN architecture, such as A1, E2, O1, F1, 
Xn, X2, and Open Fronthaul.

Each interface is implemented in its own module (e.g., `a1.py`, `e2.py`, 
`o1.py`). These modules provide classes for handling message passing and 
interactions between different network components over the corresponding 
interfaces.

# You can add any package-level imports or variables here if needed.
# For example, if you want to make some classes or functions directly
# accessible from the oransim.interfaces subpackage, you can import them here:
# from oransim.interfaces.a1 import A1Interface
# from oransim.interfaces.e2 import E2Interface
# from oransim.interfaces.o1 import O1Interface
