"""
The `simulation` subpackage provides the core simulation engine for ORANSim.

It contains the `ORANScheduler` class, which manages the simulation environment 
using SimPy, and utility functions related to simulation setup and execution.

# You can add any package-level imports here if needed. For example:
# from oransim.simulation.scheduler import ORANScheduler

# This __init__.py file can be kept relatively simple for now. 
# Its main purpose is to mark the 'simulation' directory as a Python package.
