"""
The `analytics` subpackage provides functionalities for collecting, analyzing, 
and visualizing data generated during ORANSim simulations.

It includes modules for:

- **`collector`:** Collecting and storing simulation data (KPIs, metrics, events).
- **`analyzer`:** Analyzing collected data, performing statistical calculations, 
                and generating reports.
- **`visualizer`:** Creating visualizations (plots, charts) of the simulation data 
                  and analysis results.

This subpackage aims to provide tools for:

- Monitoring the performance of the simulated network.
- Evaluating the effectiveness of different algorithms and configurations.
- Gaining insights into the behavior of ORAN components and interfaces.
- Supporting research and development in the area of 5G ORAN.
